# LinkShortener
This is a simple URL shortener application built using Flask. The application takes a long URL input from the user and generates a short, unique URL that redirects to the original long URL. This project demonstrates fundamental web development concepts, including routing, form handling, and database interactions using SQLAlchemy.
